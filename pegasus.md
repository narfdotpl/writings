How to play NES (Pegasus) games on a Mac using a PS3 controller
===============================================================

One day I decided to play [Contra][] with my very special lady friend.
It was great, although the game is *hard*.  This post contains a list of
steps I took to get the following picture:

Step 1: get an emulator
-----------------------

I used Nestopia with Emulator Enhancer.  Both are free and can be downloaded
from <http://www.bannister.org/software/nestopia.htm>.


Step 2: get a game
------------------

I downloaded a couple of [ROM][]s from [CoolROM][].

Step 3: connect a PS3 controller
--------------------------------

Connecting DualShock 3 to a Mac is tricky, but [this YouTube video][yt] can
guide you through the process.  Before trying to bind controller's buttons
in an emulator you can test it with [Joystick Show][], an 0.89 EUR app.

To turn the controller off you have to choose "disconnect" from
a Bluetooth menu:

Step 4: bind buttons
--------------------

Go to Nestopia preferences and configure buttons.  For me this was very
annoying because many times emulator didn't recognize the button pressed,
so I had to repeatedly click "Set" and push buttons on the controller.

Initially I bound arrows to arrows (duh), `X` to `A`, and `O` to `B`.
After a couple of minutes my right thumb started to hurt, so I rebound
`L1` to `A` and `L2` to `B`.

Step 5: experiment with emulator effects
----------------------------------------

In Nestopia you can tweak many settings (screen curvature, NTSC video
artifacts, etc.) to induce various levels of nostalgia:

- normal
