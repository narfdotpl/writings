  I've won an inner battle.  A major one.  In fact, I wouldn't believe
  something like this could be called a "victory", until now.  I've
  chosen the technology for my blag.  I won't use [Jekyll], I won't use
  [Hyde], I won't spend any more time writing my own engine.  I'll use
  plain text files.
